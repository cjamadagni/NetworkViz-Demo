        Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing, with syntax that is familiar to users of other technical computing environments. It is also a NumFocus project started by students at MIT which was commercialised in 2012 and is now a full fledged startup, Julia Computing.

        Juliaâ€™s LLVM-based just-in-time (JIT) compiler combined with the languageâ€™s design allow it to approach and often match the performance of C. This allows for the ease of use of languages similar to python at the performance of C.

        We have managed to create a stable, robust graph visualization library which allows the user to bring any graph or operational result to life through a 3D/2D visualization of the same.

        Salient features of our project:

        - Allows for easy toggling between 2D and 3D representations of the graph, i.e.  any graph which is input would result in a visualization being rendered which can be switched from 2D to 3D by changing the z-axis parameter allowing for a more vibrant experience.

        - Only requires adjacency matrix for graph visualization; any and all graphs to be input by the user can be done using an adjacency matrix which would now provide the opportunity to visualize the effect of various graph operations on the graph structure

        - Tight coupling with existing(non-visualization) graph libraries in Julia which allows for easier expansions in the future along with stronger credibility within the Julia community.

        - Zoom capability for careful examination of the graph and its intricate structural changes due to various operations and for viewing the larger layout of the graph allowing for a wider network topology view of the graph.
